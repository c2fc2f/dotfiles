/*
  Configures nix-index-database for the user by importing the appropriate Home
  Manager module. This setup provides an efficient way to search for files and
  commands in the Nix store.

    - The `imports` line includes the nix-index-database module, integrating
      it with Home Manager.
    - Enabling `programs.nix-index-database.comma` activates the `comma`
      command, which allows running commands from packages not yet installed
      by fetching them on demand.

  Useful for improving developer workflows by quickly locating and temporarily
  running tools.
